// 02-numberCompare.js
// Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers.
// You can choose if those numbers will be equal ==, less than <, greater than >,
// less than or equal to <=, or greater than or equal to >= each other.
// Include an if, else if, and else statement. Create an alert() that gives feedback based on the number.
// Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.
